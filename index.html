    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology
        trends because its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already
        known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants,
        ride-sharing apps and so much more. Other than that <strong>AI will be used further to analyze interactions to
            determine
            underlying connections and insights</strong>, to help predict demand for services like hospitals enabling
        authorities to
        make better decisions about resource utilization, and to detect the changing patterns of customer behaviour by
        <strong>analyzing data in near real-time, driving revenues and enhancing personalized experiences</strong>. The
        AI market will
        grow to a <strong>$190 billion industry by 2025</strong>with global spending on cognitive and AI systems
        reaching over <strong>$57
            billion in 2021</strong>. <a href="https://www.artificial-intelligence.blog/">This is webiste has really
            amazing news and latest news and blogs on Artifical Intelligence</a>. I hope you like it.
